                        of sharing of data installations and net art that will be presented in May at the 28th
                        International Symposium for Electronic Arts 2023: Symbiosis in Paris, France. Artists talks at
                        ISEA are 10 min talks that present works in progress. I am posting this because it will not be
                        published in the proceedings, but I would like this to be archived publicly somehow..</p>

                    <p>Cadavre exquis (exquisite corpse) is a collaborative drawing approach. It was first invented by surrealist artists in 1925 to create bizarre and intuitive drawings.<br>This is a fun and lighthearted evening of extraordinary creations. In this workshop participants playfully collaborate with others and manifest a creaturesque drawing using the exquisite corpse drawing method.<br>As a creative worldbuilding exercise, the group uses these drawings as a creative drawing prompt and explore narrative elements such as plot, characters, point of view, setting, theme, conflict, and style.</p>

                        creative usages within interaction design. <em>Interactive media I</em> introduces students to

                        block to a collective webzine to exist as an artifact representing the time spent in class

                    <p>The Quantified Self is best described by Gary Wolf as “self-knowledge through numbers.” William
                        James’ theory of the consciousness of the self and the study of coping inspires drawings that
                        retell personal narratives at the same time reveal traces of the subtle emotion associated with
                        intentional forgetting. Codex Endogenous is a project that reveals and visualizes the beauty and
                        morphology of a “self ” and its environment. Here, “codex” refers to a collection of pages
                        stitched together, and “endogenous” is a term in cognitive neuroscience used to describe
                        phenomena that is spontaneously generated from an individual’s internal state. Every day,
                        quantifiable information about the self is produced; left unrevealed would leave the spirit of a
                        self undiscovered. In this project, the self information is transformed into self-knowledge.
                        Data is tracked throughout a day, categorized into implicit and explicit information, visualized
                        as daily data drawings. Analogous to the practice of keeping a daily journal, Codex Endogenous
                        is a digital journal in a screen-based format. It is composed of drawings that embody data
                        representation of the quantified self in the context of environmental habituation including the
                        intentional redaction of information rather forgotten.</p>

                        <p>Theory of Mind Prism is a large scale installation takes data from the people around a space
                            but
                            instead it emits a mirror image made up of grey squares in a grid. A prism of lines
                            oscillating
                            in a light color spectrum, reminiscent of the saturation of color seen emitting from prisms
                            start to connect lines and entangling the viewer and their accompanying friends. Theory of
                            mind
                            is the psychological phenomena that lets living beings understand other’s emotional states.
                            Behavior in this space facilitated a sense of play and joy. Viewers were seen frockling past
                            the
                            installation waiting for their lines to trail behind them and entangle with their friend.

                        <p>Sense was the first idea to track myself using various devices and use the data output to
                            draw on
                            a canvas. The canvas drew out a network-like pattern that cooresponded to an accelerometer.
                            The
                            idea was that I could connect several sensors on a wristband and have it constantly emit
                            data
                            throughout the day. The result of the day would be an artistic representation generated

                            the ceiling with a projection of rain falling projection-mapped so that only the fabrics are
                            illuminated in the space. Rain sounds are strong when no one is present, rain sounds are
                            calm
                            when people are present.</p>

                            holograms. The image that is being projection-mapped onto the fabric has photos from an
                            anonymous being. There is a pulse sensor on a pedestal. Once there is a finger on the pulse
                            sensor, the color channels of the image start to become offset creating layered overlapping
                            of
                            color interactions at the rate of the current visitor’s pulse. This forces an intimate
                            interaction with the user and the anonymous being’s memories.</p>
